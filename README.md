# WebDev-Final-Project
Professional portfolio for WebDev final project.

The repository contains the source code and needed media content for a website designed using HTML, CSS, JQuery and JavaScript.

The website includes 5 major sections, home, about, resume, projects and contact me.
Each element for the sections is added using html and css. 
Flexbox and grid have been used to create the layout while bootstrap's basic nav styles and glyphicon icons are used to implement the navbar. 
The functionality of the Navbar is provided using JQuery whereas CSS media queries and hover states are used to make the navbar interactive.
The Navbar link is highlighted when the user scrolls to a particular section. It also becomes sticky when the user scrolls past the about section.
Javascipt and HTML's Canvas API are used to create the home reactive background where the mousemove event is detected which makes the particles disperse from the point where the cursor is.
The contact form contains inputs but does not have any functionality.
